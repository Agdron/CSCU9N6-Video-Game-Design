# CSCU9N6-Video-Game-Design
Video game design module, 20 Credit 3rd Year Module

Game.java is only uploaded separately as I wanted the repository to be marked as Java, it WILL NOT FUNCTION ON IT'S OWN

Turns out amongst other things, I can't work Github and don't need to upload a ZIP. This is what a year of working with Train Simulator Classic gets you

This repository is a mess now, but code should be viewable under the src folder. This can be run, you need to download the ZIP and run the game file in the out folder.
