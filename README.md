# CSCU9N6-Video-Game-Design
Video game design module, one of the better modules

Game.java is only uploaded separately as I wanted the repository to be marked as Java, it WILL NOT FUNCTION ON IT'S OWN

To view code you will need to download the ZIP, there is no point of uploading the raw code here when most of it won't make sense without the spritesheets and tilemaps
