Video game design module, 20 Credit 3rd Year Module

Game.java is only uploaded separately as I wanted the repository to be marked as Java, it WILL NOT FUNCTION ON IT'S OWN

Turns out amongst other things, I can't work Github and don't need to upload a ZIP. This is what a year of working with Train Simulator Classic gets you

Nevermind 2, can't upload more than 100 files apparently, so the ZIP will have to do. Please download that to view the code

Nevermind 3, this is a mess now, but you should be able to view all code under the src folder
